So this is the story of the man who only use voice to text to write stories. No Adam I'm not talking to you. So anyway this man was constantly interrupted by annoying roommates 
who always thought that they wanted to be in his story but they never got a part in his story but they did because he wasn't able to erase anything because he always use voice 
to text, how sad. One lonely Tuesday this man went to his local CVS and bought 7 packs of healthy dentist gum. What is healthy dentist gum? I don't know, and neither did the 
sky, but that dentists gum came back to bite him later! 

When the man was about to take the bite of one of the dentist gum, it started singing, "Almost heaven, West Virginia, Blue Ridge Mountains, Shannandoah River." Taken by surprise, 
the man went to the cashier and asked, "Ma'am, I wasn't expecting this. There's a gum here, singing." After this, the cashier told the man to bring the gum to her. Scared, the 
gum started singing even louder the words, "Country road, take me home, to the place, I belong, West Virginia, Mountain Mama, take me home, country roads!" Taking one last look
at his fellow dentist gum, he disappeared.

After his spontaneous disappearance, the man woke up underneath an underpass on the outskirts of Madison. He stood up, and followed the road signs, walking back towards downtown
Madison. On his approach, he noticed something: there were no cars on the road, and no people to be found. Becoming increasingly on edge, the man continued on his walk without
interruption for another mile. However, out of no where, his phone began to buzz violently. He looked down, only to see the dreaded four letters: ADAM, his roommate. The man
the phone only to discover that the gum had transported him to a dimension where the only two people left in existance were himself, and his dreadfully annoying roommate, Adam.
