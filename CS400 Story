So this is the story of the man who only use voice to text to write stories. No Adam I'm not talking to you. So anyway this man was constantly interrupted by annoying roommates who always thought that they wanted to be in his story but they never got a part in his story but they did because he wasn't able to erase anything because he always use voice to text, how sad. One lonely Tuesday this man went to his local CVS and bought 7 packs of healthy dentist gum. What is healthy dentist gum? I don't know, and neither did the sky, but that dentists gum came back to bite him later!
