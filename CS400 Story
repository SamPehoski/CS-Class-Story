So this is the story of the man who only use voice to text to write stories. No Adam I'm not talking to you. So anyway this man was constantly interrupted by annoying roommates 
who always thought that they wanted to be in his story but they never got a part in his story but they did because he wasn't able to erase anything because he always use voice 
to text, how sad. One lonely Tuesday this man went to his local CVS and bought 7 packs of healthy dentist gum. What is healthy dentist gum? I don't know, and neither did the 
sky, but that dentists gum came back to bite him later! 

When the man was about to take the bite of one of the dentist gum, it started singing, "Almost heaven, West Virginia, Blue Ridge Mountains, Shannandoah River." Taken by surprise, 
the man went to the cashier and asked, "Ma'am, I wasn't expecting this. There's a gum here, singing." After this, the cashier told the man to bring the gum to her. Scared, the 
gum started singing even louder the words, "Country road, take me home, to the place, I belong, West Virginia, Mountain Mama, take me home, country roads!" Taking one last look
at his fellow dentist gum, he disappeared.
